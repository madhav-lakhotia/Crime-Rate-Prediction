Crime Rate Predictor is an application that uses machine learning techniques to predict crime rates in 19 Indian metropolitan cities. The goal of this project is to assist law enforcement agencies in understanding crime patterns and allocating resources effectively to reduce crime rates and improve public safety.

## About the Application

Prevention is better that Cure. Preventing a crime from occurring is better than investigating
what or how the crime had occurred. Just like vaccination is given to a child to prevent
disease, in today's world with such higher crime rate and brutal crime happenings,
it has become necessary to have a vaccination systems that prevents from crimes happening.
By vaccinating society against crime it refers to various methods such as educating peoples,
creating awareness, increasing efficiency and proactive policing methods and other deterrent
techniques. Crime incident prediction has depends mainly on the historical crime record and
various geospatial and demographic information.

Crime rate prediction has become an important tool for law enforcement agencies
to help them better understand patterns of crime and anticipate where crime is
likely to occur. By predicting future crime trends, law enforcement agencies can
better allocate resources to areas that are likely to experience increases in
criminal activity. This could lead to a decrease in crime overall, as well as
an increase in public safety. Additionally, crime rate prediction can help police
departments develop better strategies for responding to crime as it happens.

The dataset is prepared manually based on the publication available on the Indian
National Crime Rate Bureau (NCRB) official website. This data provides statistics
on crimes committed in 19 metropolitan cities during the year 2014 to 2021.
With the help of this application, we can predict the crime rates for 10 different
categories of crime that are likely to occur in 19 Indian metropolitan cities over
the next few years. It includes statistics on 10 different categories of crime,
including murder, kidnapping, crime against women, crime against children,
crime committed by juveniles, crime against senior citizens, crime against SC,
crime against ST, economic offences and cyber crimes.

## Features

- Crime rate prediction for 10 different categories of crime
- Prediction for 19 Indian metropolitan cities
- Historical crime data from 2014 to 2021

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Crime-Rate-Prediction

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the application:
